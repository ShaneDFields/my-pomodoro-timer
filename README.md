<h2>How It's Made </h2>
<p>Tech used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React

<p>
I needed an app to help me keep on track with my work, and I knew this was the ideal project.
I created this application to further develop my state management skills while also ensuring correct coding practices. Because the functionality was the major emphasis of this project, I used simple Bootstrap styles. However, I believe that apps should still look great, so I made a few changes to make this app seem soothing while not being distracting, so you can utilize the timer and focus on your task. 
</p>


<h2>What It Does</h2>

<p> The app allows users to establish focus and break times. The length of the focus duration can be adjusted by 5 minutes. Break durations, on the other hand, 
can only be altered by one minute to ensure that you have more focus time than break time. You can also stop or pause your focus period. 
When your focus period is finished, the app will begin the break period automatically. </p>

<h2>Lessons Learned </h2>

<p> This project taught me a lot. This really made me think about state management in React and creating reusable functions that I could utilize
throughout my code without having to repeat myself. To improve readability, I'd like to refactor my code and break up my Pomodoro component into 
smaller components. </p>
